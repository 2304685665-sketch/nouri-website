# Nouri Wellness Catering – Web Prototype

This project is a functional web prototype inspired by **Nouri by Freska**, a wellness-focused catering brand.
It demonstrates a complete online ordering flow, from browsing meals to checkout and order confirmation.

The project was built specifically to showcase my understanding of web development fundamentals
and how an online food ordering system works in a real business context.
